Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils",<br>
 followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician<br>
  Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years.<br>
   The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights<br>
    to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.<br>
     Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already<br>
      had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been<br>
       challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose<br>
        control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly<br>
         extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.<br>
