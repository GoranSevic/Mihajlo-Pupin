    <p><strong>Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12 March 1935)</strong><br>
    also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist.<br>

    Pupin is best known for his numerous patents,<br> 
    including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance<br>
    telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire)<br>
    at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization").<br>

    Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for<br>
    Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later became NASA.</p>
